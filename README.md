## English

### Overview

This project enhances the official MuJoCo `simulate` application by adding a comprehensive **Real-time State Monitor** that displays all joint positions (qpos) and velocities (qvel) in real-time during simulation.

### Features

- **ðŸ“Š Complete State Monitoring**: Display all joint qpos and qvel data in real-time
- **ðŸŽ¯ Hierarchical Organization**: Clear grouping by joint name with separate qpos/qvel sections
- **âš¡ Real-time Updates**: Values update automatically during simulation
- **ðŸ’¾ Compact Display**: Optimized format to maximize information density
- **ðŸ”§ Easy Integration**: Drop-in replacement for standard MuJoCo simulate

### What's New

#### Added Functionality
- **State (qpos/qvel) Section**: New collapsible UI section in the right panel
- **Joint-based Organization**: Each joint gets its own `jointname_qpos` and `jointname_qvel` subsections
- **Compressed Format**: Displays as `index:descriptor,value` (e.g., `0:qw,0.956`)
- **Smart Descriptors**: Shortened names (`ang` for angle, `av` for angular velocity, etc.)
- **Performance Optimized**: Updates only when section is expanded

#### Technical Implementation
- **Dynamic UI Generation**: Automatically creates UI elements based on model joints
- **Real-time Data Binding**: Direct access to MuJoCo's qpos/qvel arrays
- **Efficient Updates**: 60fps update rate with minimal performance impact
- **Memory Safe**: Proper bounds checking and memory management

### Usage

1. **Compile**: Use the modified `simulate.cc` and `simulate.h` files with your MuJoCo build
2. **Run**: Launch simulate as usual: `./simulate model.xml`
3. **Monitor**: Expand the "State (qpos/qvel)" section in the right panel
4. **Observe**: Watch real-time joint state changes during simulation

### Display Format
